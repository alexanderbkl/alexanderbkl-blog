# GPT4 WILL affect YOUR JOB - new study released


![GPT-4](/images/gpt4.jpeg)


As developers, we're always excited about new technologies and breakthroughs that can help us improve our work. That's why I'm thrilled to introduce you to **GPT-4**, the latest language model created by **OpenAI**. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at what GPT-4 is capable of and how it could shape the future of AI and human collaboration.

## A Multimodal Model with Human-Like Performance

GPT-4 is a large multimodal model that can process both text and image inputs and generate text outputs that closely resemble human speech. According to OpenAI, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, which is a significant improvement over its predecessor, GPT-3.5. For example, it has been shown to perform exceptionally well on a simulated bar exam, scoring in the top 10% of test takers.

## Unleashing Creativity and Problem-Solving Abilities

One of the most impressive features of GPT-4 is its ability to handle much more nuanced instructions and generate more creative and reliable outputs than GPT-3.5. It can work with users to iterate on creative and technical writing tasks, such as composing songs or writing screenplays, and even learn a user's writing style. Additionally, it can solve complex problems with greater accuracy thanks to its broad general knowledge and advanced problem-solving abilities.

## Greater Accuracy and Reduced Disallowed Content

In terms of accuracy, GPT-4 has shown great promise. According to OpenAI, it is **82% less likely to respond to requests for disallowed content and 40% more likely to produce factual responses** than GPT-3.5. This is due to the fact that GPT-4 has been trained with more human feedback, including feedback from ChatGPT users, which has helped to improve its behavior.

## The Future of GPT-4

While GPT-4 is not yet widely available, its text input capability is currently available via **ChatGPT Plus** and the **API** (with a waitlist). OpenAI is also testing its image input capability with a single partner before rolling it out more widely.

## Impact on Developers

As for how GPT-4 will impact my job as a developer, I believe it will be a positive influence. Working with a more advanced system will provide me with an opportunity to learn and improve my skills, and collaborate more effectively with other models and humans to provide the best possible service to our users. I'm excited to see what the future holds for GPT-4 and how it will continue to shape the field of AI and language models.
